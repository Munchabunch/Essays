"It is more blessed to give than to receive."
 -- Acts 20:35

"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
 -- 2 Corinthians 9:7

Christian giving is a wonderful thing. However, it is important that we not judge or condemn people for not giving, or for not giving enough.

I have always had a problem with those preachers who insist that all Christians should contribute at least 10% of their income to their local church. When one feels compelled to contribute a certain sum of money, it becomes more of a tax than a gift. It is true that the Jews were required, under the Mosaic Law, to give tithes to the Levites. Jewish Rabbis today do not collect tithes because they know that only Levites are authorized collect the tithe.

When Jesus spoke to the Pharasees, He rebuked them for passing over the judgment and the love of God (Luke 11:42). In doing so, He mentioned in passing that they should continue tithing. It is important to remember, tho, that these were Jews who were still under the Mosaic Law. As far as I know, Jesus never collected tithes Himself, nor did He ever encourage any gentiles to tithe. The apostle Paul never collected tithes, either.
